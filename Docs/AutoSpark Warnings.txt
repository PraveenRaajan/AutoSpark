AutoSpark â€“ Important Warnings & Safety Information

Please read the following warnings carefully before using AutoSpark. These precautions are intended to prevent unintentional damage or disruption to your system.

1. DO NOT delete critical system files or folders
   - Deleting important Windows files can make your system unstable or unbootable.
   - Always double-check paths before adding delete or empty folder tasks.
   - Avoid targeting system directories like:
     - C:\Windows
     - C:\Program Files
     - C:\Users\Default
     - Any file/folder you are unsure about

2. DO NOT add shutdown, restart, or sleep tasks in the startup sequence
   - Placing these commands in the startup automation may result in a loop that restarts or shuts down your system continuously after boot.
   - This could make your PC unusable and difficult to recover without booting into Safe Mode.

3. Test your batch files before enabling them in startup
   - Always run your batch file manually first to verify it performs as expected.
   - Only move your batch file to the startup folder after you have thoroughly tested it.

4. Backup your data before using automation
   - Automation tasks can be powerful but dangerous if misconfigured.
   - Always create backups of important files before automating actions like delete, move, or rename.

5. The app runs with system-level permissions
   - Actions performed using AutoSpark may have system-wide effects.
   - Use caution, especially when enabling tasks that modify files, folders, or system settings.

You are solely responsible for any changes made to your system using AutoSpark.
Use with caution and at your own risk.
